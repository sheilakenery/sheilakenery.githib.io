# About me


After years of being relegated to career in healthcare due to cultural expectations, I realized I no longer wanted to live a life of monotony where every day is the same. Graduating college with a degree in Biological Sciences with an emphasis on Human Physiology, I thoroughly believed I kept many options open for myself to decide what would be the most fulfilling career path for me… Come to find out none of those options were a good fit.

As a millennial growing up alongside the internet, I discovered coding at a young age. From Neopets, to MySpace, to Angelfire and Geocities, I was intrigued. I was enamored. Simple manipulation of this language allowed me to express my creativity. This is something that I’ve always dabbled in as a hobby but never realized could be a career prospect.

Finally taking the plunge to switch careers, I find myself enrolled in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development Bootcamp in the Women’s Cohort. I’ve allowed myself this huge opportunity to dive deep into learning new and different languages with an up-and-coming group looking to make waves in the tech industry.
